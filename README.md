## 🌻Hello there!🌻

I'm a second year student at Jamk learning how to program good code(help).

I have played videogames almost my whole life. First I wanted to design characters and all that for videogames. That got me wondering... how do you put the character IN the game?

I discovered ✨*coding*✨

And so my burning passion for coding started a new chapter in my life... 

-🍂 Now learning: Python, Unity, frontend
