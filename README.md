## 🌻Hello there!🌻

I'm Minttu, a second year student at Jamk _(Jamk University of Applied Sciences
)_ learning how to be good programmer. I aim to be fullstack developer, more towards backend, SQL and NoSQL✨

I discovered coding trough gaming. I wanted to make art for games, then I started to wonder... How do you MAKE games?👾
Game development is my dream and passion.

Right now I'm focusing on school and making my own projects.
